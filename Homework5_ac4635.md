## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Let’s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Try to iterate ……..

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

``` r
city_prop_test = function(df) {
  
  prop.test(.....)
  
}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL") %>% 
  nest(data = resolved)
```

    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),

    ##   victim_race = col_character(),

# Problem 2

### Dataset Description:

This dataset contains information from a longitudinal study that
included a control arm and an experimental arm. Data for each
participant is included in a separate file, and file names include the
subject ID and arm. The ‘map’ function was used to iterate and read in
all of the Excel files from the zipped folder.

Create a dataframe containing all file names, tidy the result, an d
manipulate file names to include control arm and subject ID. Ensured
weekly observations are “tidy”.

``` r
long_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files(path = "./lda_data")) %>%
 mutate(
   data = map(.x = str_c("lda_data/", path), ~read_csv(.x))
    ) %>% 
unnest(data) %>% 
separate(path, into = c("Arm", "ID", "csv")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "Week",
    names_prefix = "week_",
    values_to = "Observation"
    ) %>% 
select(-csv) %>% 
mutate(
  Arm = str_replace(Arm, "con", "Control"),
  Arm = str_replace(Arm, "exp", "Experiment")
  ) %>% 
arrange(Arm, ID)
```

### Spaghetti Plot:

Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time,
and comment on differences between groups.

``` r
spag_plot = 
  long_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Week, y = Observation, group = interaction(Arm, ID), color = Arm)) + 
  geom_line(alpha=0.7) + 
  labs(
    x = "Week",
    y = "Observation",
    title = "Observations per Arm by week"
  )

spag_plot1 = 
  long_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Week, y = Observation,color = ID)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = ID)) +
  facet_grid(.~Arm) +
  labs(
    title = "Observations on each subject over time",
    x = "Week",
    y = "Observation"
  )
